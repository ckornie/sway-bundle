# Sway Bundle
## Introduction
This contains a few small additions assembled from the following sources:

- [Sway Launcher](https://github.com/Biont/sway-launcher-desktop)
- [Sway Greeting](https://git.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/gtkgreet)

The aim is to provide an easy way to install all my personal optional extras.

There is a [wiki](https://man.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/greetd/) which provides more information on configuration of the greeter.
